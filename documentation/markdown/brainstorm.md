# Brainstorm

The topics are the ideas I came up with when I did a short brainstorm about how my game should work.

- Gain money:
    - Housing citizens
        - They pay rent
        - More money based on people satisfaction
    - Build companies
        - Provide long term money
        - More money based on people satisfaction
- Levelling up:
    - XP through:
        - Collecting rent (based on satisfaction)
        - Collecting companiesâ€™ profits
        - Finishing a build
    - Unlocks:
        - Buildings
        - Decorations
        - Terrain expansions
